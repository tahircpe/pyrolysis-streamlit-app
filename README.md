# Biomass Pyrolysis
An app for the estimation of product formation from the fast pyrolysis of wood.

The app is built using Streamlit and the kinetic model used is a fork of [ccpcode/kinetic-scheme](https://github.com/ccpcode/kinetic-schemes). 

It provides a user interface to specificy the composition of the wood, temperature, and time for the pyrolysis. The kinetic model is based on [Ranzi et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2013.08.014).
